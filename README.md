# Rock Paper Scissors 🎮

A simple Rock Paper Scissors game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 🚧 Status: In Progress — Day 2

### What's done:
- Basic HTML page structure
- ✅ JavaScript game logic added (inline)
- CPU randomly picks Rock, Paper, or Scissors using `Math.random()`
- Win / Lose / Tie result shown via `alert()`

### Concepts covered:
- `Math.random()` to generate random numbers
- `if / else if` statements for game logic
- Boolean comparisons with `===`
- Variables with `let` and `const`

### What's coming:
- Move JS into a separate `script.js` file
- CSS styling
- Replace `alert()` with on-page result display

## How to Run
Open `index.html` in your browser and click a button.
