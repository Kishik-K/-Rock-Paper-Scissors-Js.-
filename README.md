# Rock Paper Scissors 🎮

A simple Rock Paper Scissors game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 🚧 Status: In Progress — Day 3

### What's done:
- ✅ HTML structure
- ✅ Game logic working
- ✅ JavaScript moved into separate `script.js` file
- ✅ Result now displays on the page instead of an alert popup

### Project structure:
```
rock-paper-scissors/
├── index.html
└── script.js
```

### Concepts covered:
- `Math.random()` for randomness
- `if / else if` statements
- Boolean comparisons with `===`
- `document.getElementById()` for DOM manipulation
- Separating concerns — HTML and JS in different files

### What's coming:
- `style.css` for visual design

## How to Run
Open `index.html` in your browser and click a button.

*This project is being built step by step as part of learning JavaScript fundamentals — booleans, if/else statements, and DOM manipulation.*
